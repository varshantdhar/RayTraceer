;; ====== correctness

;; === making textures ===
;; vertical striped texture		8 / 8
-2 - wrong coloring
;; horizontal striped texture		2 / 8
-6 - only one stripe shows (stripe that shows is correct)
;; waves texture			8 / 8

;; === texture mapping  ===
;; poster texture mapping		5 / 8
-3 - vertical map does not show
;; sphere texture mapping		5 / 8
-3 - vertical map does not show

;; === lighting ===
;; sphere is brighter on one side than the other 8 / 8
;; sphere casts a shadow on the poster  8 / 8
;; handles light position change 8 / 8
;; poster casts shadow on large sphere 3 / 3
;; lower ambient light darkens picture 3 / 3

;; development process		     15 / 15

;; adequate tests                     3 / 5
-2 - no tests for logical_loc

;; well-written purposes              0 / 2
-2 - many missing purposes
;; proper indentation, line breaks    1 / 2
-1 - several counts of inconsistent or improper indentation
;; well-named variables		      2 / 2
